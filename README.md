# HexSoftwares_CaliforniaHouseProcePrediction

🏡 California House Price Prediction
This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting median house prices in California using the California Housing Dataset. It was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at HexSoftwares.

📌 Key Highlights:
EDA & Data Cleaning: Distribution analysis, skewness correction, outlier detection.

Feature Engineering: Created geospatial distance features from Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Modeling: Built and evaluated Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV for optimized model performance.

Evaluation: Compared models using cross-validation and test set metrics.

📂 Tools & Libraries:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-Learn, XGBoost

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
